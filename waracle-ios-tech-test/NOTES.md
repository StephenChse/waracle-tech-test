### Any suggestions of things you would add, improve or do differently with more time

Design Updates
- Potentially find a more fitting placeholder image
- Update fonts and sizes for text and sub text

Functionality Updates
- Look to include swipe to delete functionality 
- Depending on scope of the project, could look to save data from api in core data so we aren't running API call everytime
- Can have a sync/polling function running in the background for api updates
- Find another API or have more details to populate detail pages for cakes
- Add toolbar navigation to allow for additional screens
- Allow for favourite functionality so user can save favourite cakes for quick access
- Have search, sort or filtering functionality to quickly search results


### Any other comments or information about your solution
- Updated structure to use MVVMC 
- Used await and async over closures
